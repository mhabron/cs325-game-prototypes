<h2>Angels and Demons</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I created all the visual assets except for the font.
Most of the code is original, although I did borrow somewhat
from my previous shooter project.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I believe the shifting of game states and the implementation of power-ups is interesting.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

I learned how to use states properly in Phaser.
The hardest part of this project was definitely making sure the states were properly set up.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the angel, demon, backgrounds, power-up, and shot sprites by myself.
Code was borrowed from my "Cat Snack Fever" project which in turn borrowed code from
the "Invaders" example game on Phaser's website.

<li>Title Music: Final Fantasy IV Prelude by Nobuo Uematsu</a></li>
<li>Game Music: Sky Chase Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 by SEGA</a></li>
<li>End Music: Final Fantasy IV Victory Fanfare by Nobuo Uemastsu</a></li>
<li>Sound Effects: Sonic the Hedgehog 1 Sound Effects by SEGA</a></li>
<li>Font: Pixelbroidery by Tusoud on FontSpace.com</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Closest other game would be, as previously stated, the "Invaders" example game on Phaser's website.
<ul>
<li></a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
An angel is on the hunt against demons that threaten the land.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the "person with wings" theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Used multiple states.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This project is analysing the mechanic of multiple states.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Ideally, the player should experience excitement while trying their best to both avoid demons and rack up enough score
to beat the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players use the left and right arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot, the player must avoid the demons that
are rushing toward the player while also being sure to shoot enough of them to achieve a high score. Power ups
can be collected to increase a score multiplier.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
An effective strategy would be to master precise movement of the player character to make sure you don't lose all your lives
but are able to get a shot at the enemy to score up points. Collecting power-ups will increase your score multiplier to
hasten your accruement of points!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise of the game is that you play as an angel fighting against demons, and to complete your quest
you have to eliminate a certain number of demons/ collect enough "halo" power-ups!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A casual gamer, with no more than a cursory knowledge of top-down shooters.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
~ 3 minutes
</li>
