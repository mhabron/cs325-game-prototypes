<h2>Cat Snack Fever</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I made all of the sprites, and modified some of the code for enemy
creation and shooting.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I think the enemy creation algorithm is interesting in how it
randomly places the enemy at the top of the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned some of the basics of Phaser, and learned a little about sprite animation.
The hardest part was definitely making sure the enemies/player reacted correctly to
being hit.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all of the visual assets, however I did not create the sound effects or music.

BGM: Mitchiri-Neko March by Mitchiri-Neko Marching Band (Paid for on Amazon Music)

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed code from the Phaser Example "Invader" and modified it to change a few things.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A simple and fun game about shooting snacks at hungry cats!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Not Relevant.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Not Relevant.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is evaluating the mechanics shooting controls and enemy generation.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The ideal experience is for players to feel joy at feeding cats by shooting at them
in a cute and cartoony environment.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move left and right using the arrow keys, and use the space bar to shoot. The core mechanic revolves around shooting the cats to acquire points in the attempt to achieve a higher and higher score each time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective strategies would involve avoiding enemies and their projectiles,and navigating your ship to try and get as many points as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise is that there are a bunch of hungry cats approaching the player, and to satisfy them the player shoots snacks
at the cats to satiate their appetite. There really isn't a deep story to the game, it's more abstract.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is casual gamers, particularly those who are new to shooting games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game lasts as long as the player has enough lives to continue.
</li>
