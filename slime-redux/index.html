<h2>Spot the Slime!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I made all of the sprites, as well as all of the code for the project.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I think the automatic timing of events such as text pop-ups, and slime generation, is worthy of merit.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned some more about Phaser, particuarly about group properties and the timer
events that can be done to control game flow.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all of the visual assets, however I did not create the sound effects or music.
<ul>
</ul>
Splat sound effect from Mike Koeing on soundbible.com
Wrong buzzer sound effect from Alexander on orangefreesounds.com
Background music: 'Sticker of Puyo Puyo' from Puyo Puyo Soundtrack by SEGA
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is a reiterated version of my <a href="cs325-game-prototypes/mult-click">Spot the Slime!</a> game that I made a few weeks earlier.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A simple game about seeing how many slimes you can find!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Not Relevant.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Multi-player, Point-and-Click
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is evaluating the mechanics of point-and-click controls and multiplayer options.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The ideal experience is for players is a sense of competition as Player 2 tries to out do
Player 1's score by finding more slimes within the time limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The players take turns using the cursor to click on slimes. The color of the slime the player
is looking for is chosen at random and displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Each time the correct slime is clicked,the current player's score is increased, and any time a wrong 
slime is clicked, the timer gets reduced by one second. Player 2 takes control after Player 1's 
timer runs out. After Player 2's turn, a final round is played where the slimes now move, and any
points earned in this round are worth double. In the end, the person with the highest score is 
declared winner and the game resets.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective strategies would involve paying close attention to which of the slimes look different.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The premise is that there are a bunch of slimes laid out in front of you, and one slime is unique amongst the group.
The players have to find as many of these unique slimes as possible. There really isn't a deep story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is casual gamers, as well as a group of atleast 2 people.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Each game round lasts about 4 minutes, and can be repeated as many times as necessary.
</li>
