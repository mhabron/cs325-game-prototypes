<h2>'Ninja' Digital Prototype #1</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is a cross between a 2D platformer and a hack'n'slash game with several types of weapons.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I utilized a tileset and tilemap to design the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to utilize tilesets and tilemaps, as well as how to code gravity into the game.
The hardest part of desigining this prototype was being sure that the tileset would properly
display on the map, since Phaser has some issues if the tileset isn't pre-embedded.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
I designed the sword, throwing star, and goal post sprites by myself, all other assets were
taken from an open-source game resource site called Opengameart.org.
All sprites borrowed form this website are public domain and free to be used with expressed
permission from the authors.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>

<ul>
I borrowed some code from the "Map Collide" example on Phaser's website, as well borrowed some code from myself
pre-existing game "Cat Fever" with regards to the shooting mechanic.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A 2D platforming hack'n'slash where you simply try to reach the end of the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Not Applicable.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I created a 2D platformer with combat elements, which is a game genre I have not
previously attempted.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the movement and combat mechanics for my final iteration.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The desired experience for players would be a sense of speed and grace as they avoid or fight enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player uses the left and right arrow keys to move, the up arrow key to jump, and the Z and X buttons to fire a throwing star
or attack with a sword respectively once they collect the necessary items.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The main strategy would involve players avoiding enemies until they receive a weapon to fight with.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The basic premise of this game is that you play as a ninja trying to fight against his enemies as he makes
his way towards the goal at the other end of the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience would be 2D platformer fans or fans of games with ranged or melee combat.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This should have an average play time of around 3 minutes.
</li>
